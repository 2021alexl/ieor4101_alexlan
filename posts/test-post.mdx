# Events and Event Spaces

## Samples

Omega refers to sample space, which is the result of an experiment

Example: if you toss a coin twice:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Omega&space;=&space;{HH,&space;HT,&space;TH,&space;TT}&space;)

## Event

Event is the subset of Sample

For example: first toss is head (two tosses in total) = {HH, HT}

## Event Space (S)

Event space is a set of events, it is closed under a finite union & measurements.

Event space entails binary operation: like unions, diffs, etc.

## Probability Measure

Define over (sample, event space) s.t.

1. for all a in S ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(a)&space;\geq&space;0)

2. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(\Omega&space;)&space;=&space;1)

3. if a and b are disjoint: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(a&space;\cup&space;&space;b)&space;=&space;P(a)&space;&plus;&space;P(b))

3 is a special form of this equation, because a and b are disjoint, their intersaction is 0: 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(\alpha&space;\cup&space;\beta&space;)&space;=&space;P\left&space;(&space;\alpha&space;&space;\right&space;)&space;&plus;P(\beta&space;)&space;-P(\alpha&space;\cap&space;\beta&space;)&space;)
