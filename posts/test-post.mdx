# Events and Event Spaces

## Samples

Omega refers to sample space, which is the result of an experiment

Example: if you toss a coin twice:

## Event

Event is the subset of Sample

For example: first toss is head (two tosses in total) = {HH, HT}

## Event Space (S)

Event space is a set of events, it is closed under a finite union & measurements.

Event space entails binary operation: like unions, diffs, etc.

## Probability Measure

Define over (sample, event space) s.t.
