# Events and Event Spaces

## Samples

Omega refers to sample space, which is the result of an experiment
Example: if you toss a coin twice:

\Omega$ = {HH, HT, HT, TT}

## Event

Event is the subset of Sample, for example: first toss is head (two tosses in total) = {HH, HT}

## Event Space (S)

Event space is a set of events, it is closed under a finite union & measurements.

Event space entails binary operation: like unions, diffs, etc.
