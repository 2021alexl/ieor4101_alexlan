# 1 Probability Practice Problem

## Q1

A bag contains seven fair coins and three unfair coins. The fair coins have a 1/2 probability of landing on heads. The unfair coins have a 9/10 probability of landing on heads. The coins are indistinguishable by looking at them.

Select one coin from the bag at random and flip that same coin five times. What is the probability that the coin lands on heads exactly twice? 

### ANS

Let F be the event that a fair coin was chosen. Let A be the event that exactly 2 heads were tossed.
Because there are 10 coins in the bag and seven are fair:

and 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(F^c)&space;=&space;3/10)

If a fair coin is chosen then there are 5nCr2 (five choose two) possible positions for the heads, each head has a probability of 21 and each tail has a probability of 1/2 so
 
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(A|F)&space;=&space;\binom{5}{2}(1/2)^5)

If an unfair coin is chosen, then there are 5nCr2 (five choose two) possible positions for the heads, each head has a probability of 9/10 and each tail has a probability of 1/10 so

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(A|F^c)&space;=&space;\binom{5}{2}(9/10)^2(1/10)^3)

Use the law of total probability and the values we found above to conclude that

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(A)=&space;P(A|F)P(F)&plus;&space;P(A|F^c)P(F^c)&space;=&space;\binom{5}{2}(1/2)^5&space;&plus;&space;\binom{5}{2}(9/10)^3(1/10^2))

## Q2

In the Moderna coronavirus vaccine trial, 14,134 people were given two doses of a vaccine and 14,073 people were given two doses of a placebo. 185 people in the placebo group became infected with COVID-19. 11 people in the vaccinated group became infected with COVID-19.


### Q2-A

Calculate the efficacy of the Moderna vaccine.

#### Q2-A ANS

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(P(I|V^c)-P(I|V))/P(I|V^c)&space;=&space;((185/14073)&space;-&space;(11/14134))/(185/14073))

where V is the event that somebody was vaccinated and I is the event that somebody was infected with the viru

### Q2-B

If you were a participant in the trial and you know that you did not become infected with the virus, what is the probability that you received a real vaccine instead of a placebo

#### Q2-A ANS

Solve this using Bayes’s Theorem:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(P(V|I^c)&space;=&space;P(I^c|V)P(V)/P(I^c))

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(I^c|V)&space;=&space;(14134-11)/14134)

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(V)&space;=&space;14134/(14134&plus;14073)&space;=&space;0.50108)

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(I^c)&space;=&space;1-&space;(11&plus;185)/(14134&plus;14073)&space;=&space;0.99305)

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(P(V|I^c)&space;=&space;P(I^c|V)P(V)/P(I^c)&space;=&space;0.99922*0.50108/0.99305&space;=&space;0.506)

### Q3

You roll a fair die 10 times. Each roll of the die is independent of all of the other rolls. 

Let X be a random variable that represents the number of times the die lands on 2 during these ten rolls.

(A) Write down the pmf for X.

(B) Calculate P(X ≤ 4). 

#### Q3-A ANS

This is a binomial random variable with n = 10 and p = 1/6

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P_&space;{x}(x)&space;=&space;\binom{10}{x}&space;(1/6)^x&space;(5/6)^{10-x})

#### Q3-B ANS

Use PMF to calculate P(X ≤ 4)

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P(x\leq&space;4)&space;=&space;\sum_{0}^{4}P(X=x)&space;)


### Q4

A random number X is chosen uniformly from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

Then, after X has been chosen, another random number Y is chosen uniformly from the set {1,...,X}. For example, if X = 4, then Y is chosen uniformly from {1, 2, 3, 4}. If X = 6, then Y is chosen uniformly form {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

(A) Write down the marginal pmf pX and the conditional pmf pY|X

(B) Find the joint pmf pX,Y

(C) Write an expression for the marginal pmf pY

(D) Find E(Y)


#### Q4-A ANS

Marginal PMF for x:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P_{x}(x)&space;=&space;1/10&space;)

if x = 1,2,3,...,10 (0 otherwise) -- because it is uniformly distributed

Conditional PMF:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P_{Y|X}(y|x)&space;=&space;1/x)

if x = 1,2,3,...,10 (0 otherwise) and y = 1,...,x (0 otherwise)

#### Q4-B ANS

By the multiplication rule:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P_{Y,X}(y,x)&space;=&space;p_{x}(x)P_{Y|X}(y|x)=&space;1/10x)

if x = 1,2,3,...,10 (0 otherwise) and y = 1,...,x (0 otherwise)

#### Q4-C ANS

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P_{Y}(y)&space;=&space;\sum_{x=y}^{10}1/10x)

#### Q4-D ANS

If X = x, then Y is uniform on {1,...,x}. Therefore

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?E(Y|X=&space;x)&space;=&space;\sum_{y=1}^{x}&space;y/x&space;=&space;(x&plus;1)/2)

By the law of total expectation:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?E(Y)&space;=&space;\sum_{10}^{x=1}E(Y|X=&space;x)P(X=x)&space;=&space;\sum_{10}^{x=1}&space;(x&plus;1)/20&space;=&space;13/4)

(B) Calculate E(X)

(C) Calculate Var(X)

#### Q5-B ANS

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?E(X)&space;=&space;\int_{0}^{2}&space;x^2/2dx&space;=&space;4/3)

#### Q5-D ANS

Because X has the range [0,2], it follows that X^2 will have the range [0,4], so we calculate the CDF. For any Z in [0,4]:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_{Z}(z)&space;=&space;P(X^2\leq&space;z)&space;=&space;P(X\leq&space;\sqrt{z}))

Write it in terms of fx:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_{z}(z)&space;=&space;\int_{0}^{\sqrt{z}}&space;x/2dx&space;=&space;z/4)

Finally take the derivative:
