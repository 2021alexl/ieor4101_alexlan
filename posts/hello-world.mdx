# Overview

IEOR E4101 Probability Models is a required core course.

You have an option to take the full course (3 points) or request to take a waiver exam to take the half course (1.5 points)

Based on the information provided by 2017 IEOR 4101 Syllabus[link](https://ieor.columbia.edu/files/seas/content/docs/ieor4100_fall_2017_syllabus.pdf), I made three modules, which are [Probability](/posts/test-post), [Applied Statistics](/posts/one-more-post), and [Simulation](/posts/another-post-in-the-wall).

I designed this website to provide brief overviews of topics covered in this course, aiming to help me and my classmates to waive this exam, but also aim to provide a systematic and succint coverage of statistics topics.
