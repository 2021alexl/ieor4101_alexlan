Based on the information provided by 2017 IEOR 4101 Syllabus[link](https://ieor.columbia.edu/files/seas/content/docs/ieor4100_fall_2017_syllabus.pdf), I made three modules, which are [Probability](/posts/test-post), [Applied Statistics](/posts/one-more-post), and [Simulation](/posts/another-post-in-the-wall).
