# Overview

This website is designed to give a brief cover of mathematical/theoretical knowledge for finance/business analytics, as for Columbia University's MSBA program, it is IEOR E4101 -- Probability Models which is a required core course.

You have an option to take the full course (3 points) or request to take a waiver exam to take the half course (1.5 points)

Based on the information provided by 2017 IEOR 4101 Syllabus[link](https://ieor.columbia.edu/files/seas/content/docs/ieor4100_fall_2017_syllabus.pdf), I made three modules, which are [Probability](/posts/test-post), [Applied Statistics](/posts/one-more-post), and [Simulation](/posts/another-post-in-the-wall).

I designed this website to provide brief overviews of topics covered in this course, aiming to help me and my classmates to waive this exam, but also aim to provide a systematic and succint coverage of statistics topics.

# Side Note for Undergrads in Boston University

If you are an undergraduate stundent in BU with math-related majors, you might find this website practically helpful as many of the contents is summarized from my undergraduate note. For the applied statistics page, it covers essential content of MA213/214 and theoretical basis of MA415/416/EC303/EC304.. FOr the probability page, it is mainly extracted from MA581 course, and it is also the foundation of MA582/MA583/MA577....

# For Peers intended to Go to the Finance Field

This website knowledge is required for CFA level 1 test, and also other pertinent tests. As a student who is willing to go to the finance field, I recognize the relationship between math and finance as -- I strongly recommend any peers who wants to do finance in the future to study statistics, probability, differential equation, estimation, stochastic, and their application on finance (including topics like martingale, brownian motion, markov process...) Even though only a small portion of finance major people will finally get the position that you need to analyze the stock, and only a small portion of those people are allowed/ or asked to leverage quant methods, (which means sadly most of the chances those knowledge can never be directly applied). The reason I encourage my peers to do so is that learning these knowledge actually helps you to understand the field of finance.. or even the word finance better, and meanwhile, I believe those knowledge will raise rationality of financial analyzers even though they do not directly leverage quant methods.
